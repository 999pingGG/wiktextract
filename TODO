XXX Some very common words (e.g., green, die, time, plant, be, king)
have separate translation pages, e.g., green/translations).  There are
enough of these that they should be handled separately and added to
the senses in question.

XXX It is fairly common to have {{en-phrase}} under ==Verb==.  What
part-of-speech should these be?

XXX generate proper list of language tags and start using it

Qualifiers specified after {{l|...}} do not get included in output,
e.g., Galician "ano" Etymology 2

Galiacian Proverb list has a strange item

XXX check handling of "alter" at the beginning of parse_any(), is it correct?

XXX change wiktwords to output senses rather than words

XXX check variant vs. data in page.py; is variant properly added?

XXX Redo formatting of {{place|...}} (need custom code)

Check Spanish "capitales" - has two es-noun items with different
gender&meaning.  Are these more common?

- check: Portuguese (need consultation?)
  - pt-pron def (various ways to express pronoun)
  - pt-pronoun-with-n
  - pt-pronoun-with-l

- check: Japanese (need consultation?)
  - ja-verb form of

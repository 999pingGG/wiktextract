# XXX cf "word" translations under "watchword" and "proverb" - what kind of
# link/ext is this?  {{trans-see|watchword}}

# XXX add parsing chinese pronunciations, see 傻瓜 https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%82%BB%E7%93%9C#Chinese

# XXX implement parsing {{ja-see-kango|xxx}} specially, see むひ

# XXX linkages may have senses, e.g. "singular" English "(being only one):"
#  - also, linkage parenthesized parts may inappropriately end up in tags,
#    e.g., 假設/Chinese/Verb/Synonyms

# XXX check use of sense numbers in translations (check "eagle"/English)

# XXX capture {{taxlink|...}} and {{verb|...}} in linkage and gloss.
# Handle the parenthesized expression.  Note that sometimes it is not taxlink,
# just an italicized link in parenthesis

# XXX figure out:  (maybe string vs. ustring error in my lua code?)
# duck: ERROR: invalid unicode returned by ('translations', 'show') parent ('Template:t', {1: 'xal', 2: 'нуһсн'}) at ['duck', 't', '#invoke', 'Lua:translations:show()']

# XXX in Coordinate terms, handle bullet point titles like Previous:, Next:
# (see "ten", both Coordinate terms and Synonyms)

# XXX change pronunciation parsing to traverse LIST and then expand individual
# items (warn about non-list content), similar to already done for linkage

# XXX parse synonyms and other linkages from (referenced) thesaurus pages

# XXX parse etymology; take "compound", "affix", prefix" templates and save
# as dictionaries under "compound"

# XXX parse "alter" tags; see where they are used (they seem to be alternate
# forms)

# XXX parse "enum" tags (args: lang, prev, next, value)

# XXX investigate linkage sections that do not contain a link. What are they
# like and how to handle them?

# XXX check use of ja-r and ja-r/args templates in linkage and capture
# hira, kana

# XXX parse <form> of ... glosses.  There are LOTS of these.

# XXX make sure parenthesized parts in the middle of form-of descriptions
# in gloss are handled properly.  Check "vise" (Swedish verb).

# XXX check translation hub

# XXX check allowed head templates, see template_allowed_pos_map

# XXX test that config.capture_* options work

# XXX distinguish non-gloss definition from gloss, see e.g. βούλομαι

# XXX check "unsupported tag component 'E' warning / in "word"

# XXX parse "id" field in {{trans-top|id=...}} (and overall parse wikidata ids)

# XXX implement support for image files in {{mul-symbol|...}} head, e.g.,
# Unsupported titles/Cifrão

# XXX Some declination/conjugation template arguments contain templates, e.g.
# mi/Serbo-Croatian (pronoun).  Should probably strip these templates, but
# not strip as aggressively as normal clean_value() does.  HTML tags and links
# should be stripped.

# XXX review inserting error/warning tags in words that trigger errors/warnings

# XXX clean up extra calls to map_with in form_descriptions.py; now handled
# in decode_tags()

# XXX parse "Derived characters" section.  It may contain multiple
# space-separated characters in same list item.

# XXX extract Readings section (e.g., Kanji characters)

# XXX handle qualifiers starting with "of " specially.  They are quite common
# for adjectives, describing what the adjective can characterize

# XXX parse "object of a preposition", "indirect object of a verb",
# "(direct object of a verb)", "(as the object of a preposition)",
# "(as the direct object of a verbal noun)",
# in parenthesis at the end of gloss

# XXX parse [+infinitive = XXX], [+accusative = XXX], etc in gloss
# see e.g. βούλομαι.  These come from {{+obj|...}}, might also just parse
# the template.

# XXX parse "construed with XXX" from sense qualifiers or capture "construed with" template

# XXX add warnings about / in places where we try to parse tags

# XXX how about gloss "The name of the letter X",

# the same without The
# Letter of the X syllabary, transcribed as X
# Letter of the Tagbanwa abugida, transcribed as syllable X
# Letter of the X script, transcribed as X
# Letter of the X alphabet ...
# Letter of the X alphabet: ...

# XXX how about gloss "Compound of XXX and YYY".  There are 100k of these.
#   - sometimes followed by semicolon and notes or "-" and notes
#   - sometimes Compound of gerund of XXX and YYY
#   - sometimes Compound of imperative (noi form) of XXX and YYY
#   - sometimes Compound of imperative (tu form) of XXX and YYY
#   - sometimes Compound of imperative (vo form) of XXX and YYY

#   - sometimes Compound of XXX + YYY
#   - sometimes Compound of the gerund of XXX and YYY
#   - sometimes Compound of the imperfect XXX and the pronoun YYY
#   - sometimes Compound of the infinitive XXX and the pronoun YYY

# XXX occasionally Alternative form of ... followed by Alternative spelling of,
#   see &c

# XXX handle "Wiktionary appendix of terms relating to animals" ("animal")

# XXX check "Kanji characters outside the ..."

# XXX parenthized parts in linkages are often word senses.  Perhaps separate
# to a sense field.  Need support in htmlgen too.

# XXX recognize "See also X" from end of gloss and move to a "See also" section

# XXX handle word class prefixes in linkages, see sade/Finnish,
# "adjectives: sateeton, sateinen"

# Look at "prenderle"/Italian - two heads under same part-of-speech.  Second
# head ends up inside first gloss.

# XXX make sure Alternative forms section is parsed (see, e.g., "& cetera")
# Also add to htmlgen.

# XXX handle (classifier XXX) at beginning of gloss; also (classifier: XXX)
# and (classifiers: XXX, XXX, XXX)
# E.g.: 煙囪
# Also: 筷子 (this also seems to have synonym problems!)

# XXX parse redirects, create alt_of

# XXX Handle "; also YYY" syntax in initialisms (see AA/Proper name)

# XXX parse see also, create "related"?

# In htmlgen, create links from gloss, at minimum when whole gloss matches
# a word form in the same language (or maybe gloss as an alternative?)

# Check Finnish Abbreviation snses - many of them parentheses which are parsed
# incorrectly in alt_of

# XXX parse {{zh-see|XXX}} - see 共青团

# XXX is the Usage notes section parseable in any useful way?  E.g., there
# is a template {{cmn-toneless-note}}.  Are there other templates that would
# be useful and common enough to parse, e.g., into tags?

# XXX parse {{topics|lang|...|...}} - these seem to generate
# topic-related Categories.  However they can only be associated with
# the language, not sense or part-of-speech (unless inside sense).
# These are cleaner than trying to capture Category links.

# XXX capture topic hierarchy from Category pages in Wiktionary
#   - Module:category tree/topic cat/data/* (except /documentation)
#   - beware, at least .../Places contains real code besides data
#   - Load place types from Module:place/data
#   - also: Module:place/shared-data/tables
#   - also: Module:place/shared-data
# May be best to actually load these modules as Lua code or to even run a
# specific Lua module to dump the data.

# Parse gender in linkages, e.g., ξένος/Greek (m in linkages)

# Check awake/English - strange unrecognized tags

# XXX search for Template: from all glosses, search for &amp; from all glosses

# XXX implement parsing of tags from first-level gloss in two-level lists
#    (see cut/English/Noun)

# XXX in parse_head_tags(), should create multiple forms if
# node["$"].get("tags") contains multiple sets of tags (e.g., cut/English/Verb)

# Check te/Spanish/pron, See also section (warning, has unexpected format)

# Check alt_of with "." remaining.  Find them all to a separate list
# and analyze.

# When alt-of has English translation (often in quotes), try to capture it
# (helpful for disambiguation!).  E.g., 假設/Vietnamese

# XXX related terms, wikipedia, Wikispecies links.  See "permit"/English/Noun

# Check linkage sol/Norwegian Nynorsk/Noun (looks like unhandled item list)
#  - This is a broader problem around col1 ... col5 and col1-u ... col5-u.
#    They expand to <div> inside <div> that contains a list.  They are
#    fairly widely used in at least linkages.

# XXX "magic number"/English - why is tag included in gloss?  Perhaps
# the tag has extra parentheses?
#  - tags need to be processed from outer gloss
#  - note also the duplication of some senses, FIX!

# XXX handle inflection of with multiple forms; see aquamarine/German/Adjective
#   - This is tricky.  This case is generated by {{de-adj form of|...}} and there
#     is no knowing how many such templates there are.  We may need to treat
#     the sub-entries as either equal senses or sub-senses.
#   - we should also fix treatment of *# etc; we need to just expand to
#     HTML, then split there (at line start), and then clean.  Otherwise we
#     risk breaking glosses that contain * or # (e.g., math formulas).

# Check that 1/Translingual/Alternative forms is parsed correctly

# XXX analyze remaining parentheses in linkage.  Currently debug message
# disabled.  There are still lots of these.

# XXX Finland/English has strange topic in related
#   - there is a {{topics|...}} tag in the linkage; however, I think we should
#     really interpret it as "sense" for the linkage.

# XXX comb/English - something wrong with parsing translations
#  - could one of the templates get expanded???
#  - this might just be an instance of the list not being found inside HTML
#    (need to recurse instead of just iterating contents)

# XXX handle <ruby> specially in clean or perhaps already earler, see
# e.g. 無比 (Japanese)

# XXX There are way too many <noinclude> not propersy closed warnings
# forom Chinese, e.g., 內 - find out what causes these, and either fix or
# ignore

# XXX Lua error on 龜 - test again after next Wiktionary dump, this might be
# due to undefined language in Lua module

# Parse readings subsection in Japanese kanji characters, see 內
#  - these are apparently pronunciations, but not IPA
#  - perhaps these might be parsed as forms with "reading" tag and tag
#    for the type of reading?

# Korean kanji seem to have Phonetic hangeul in pronunciation sections, see 內

# XXX test ISBN / Japanese - how does word entry work, how do synonyms
# work (relates to <ruby> handling)

# Handle Japanese parentheses in linkage items.  It think this relates
# to <ruby>.

# Implement <hiero> ... </hiero>, e.g., lilja/Finnish/Etymology

# Implement <chem> ... </chem>, e.g. felsic/English/Adjective

# Improve htmlgen lists
#   - more even sizes of sublists (use intervals when appropriate)
#   - group kanji etc by radical + strokes

# XXX chinese glyphs, see 內
#  - I'm getting dial-syn page does not exist in synonyms, but Wiktionary
#    shows a big list of synonyms

# XXX Some Chinese words have weird /wiki.local/ in sounds, see: 屋
#  - also in pronunciations, several IPAs are captured, but they are not
#    annotated with dialect information
#  - this page also has dial-syn warning in synonyms (also noted elsewhere)
#  - in Japanese compounds, roman transliterations incorrectly go into tags
#  - in Japanese, does it make sense to have most senses annotated with "kanji"?

# Check what is failing in these:
# /Arabic/Noun: ERROR: LUA error in #invoke ('ar-nominals', 'show_noun') parent ('Template:ar-decl-noun', {1: 'كَلَب'}) at ['كلب', 'ar-decl-noun', '#invoke']
# attempt to index a nil value
# stack traceback:
# 	[C]: in for iterator 'for iterator'

# 	(...tail calls...)
# 	[C]: in function 'xpcall'
# 	[string "<python>"]:235: in function 'lua_invoke'

# canadensis/Latin "third-declension two-termination adjective" is not
# parsed (it is not in parentheses).  This type of construction is very
# common in Latin.

# tear/English/Verb - "tore" in head has error-unknown tag for
# "or (now colloquial and nonstandard)"

# Form-of detection does not work for many Spanish forms, e.g.:
# bachaquea/Spanish/Verb

# compound-of field of sense not displayed in generated html

# form-of (and alt-of) links in generated html should look at
# canonical form in addition to word - now many items with accents are
# not properly linked

# 䆀手/Chinese - Synonyms has * The dial-syn page 「左手」 does not yet exist. Create the data page and the map!* The dial-syn page 「左撇子」 does not yet exist. Create the data page and the map!
# Things like this seem very common with Chinese words.  Might be a problem
# in Lua code where they are looked up (Wiktionary does have synonyms).

# English/fire/Noun (oxidation reaction) - Egptian, "f" in roman versions seems
# to go into "roman" field, even though it is apparently gender

# XXX handle "XXX/derived terms" pages

/derived terms (seem to be referenced with {{section link|...}}

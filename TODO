the senses in question.

gender&meaning.  Are these more common?  Currently only one of them
gets included.

XXX Qualifiers specified in linkages after {{l|...}} do not get
included in output, e.g., Galician "ano" Etymology 2.  Not sure how
common this is overall.

XXX check handling of "alter" at the beginning of parse_any(), is it correct?

XXX change wiktwords to output senses rather than words

XXX check variant vs. data in page.py; is variant properly added?

XXX Redo formatting of {{place|...}} (need custom code)
XXX lots of other things also need custom code.  Perhaps just call the lua
code of modules for that?

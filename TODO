# XXX cf "word" translations under "watchword" and "proverb" - what kind of
# link/ext is this?  {{trans-see|watchword}}

# XXX add parsing chinese pronunciations, see 傻瓜 https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%82%BB%E7%93%9C#Chinese

# XXX implement parsing {{ja-see-kango|xxx}} specially, see むひ

# XXX check use of sense numbers in translations (check "eagle"/English)

# XXX in Coordinate terms, handle bullet point titles like Previous:, Next:
# (see "ten", both Coordinate terms and Synonyms)

# XXX change pronunciation parsing to traverse LIST and then expand individual
# items (warn about non-list content), similar to already done for linkage

# XXX parse etymology; take "compound", "affix", prefix" templates and save
# as dictionaries under "compound"

# XXX parse "alter" tags; see where they are used (they seem to be alternate
# forms)

# XXX parse "enum" tags (args: lang, prev, next, value)

# XXX check use of ja-r and ja-r/args templates in linkage and capture
# hira, kana

Parse Phonetic hangeul in Pronunciation section (see 死/Korean)

# XXX make sure parenthesized parts in the middle of form-of descriptions
# in gloss are handled properly.  Check "vise" (Swedish verb).

# XXX check translation hub

# XXX check allowed head templates, see template_allowed_pos_map

# XXX test that config.capture_* options work

# XXX distinguish non-gloss definition from gloss, see e.g. βούλομαι

# XXX check "unsupported tag component 'E' warning / in "word"

# XXX parse "id" field in {{trans-top|id=...}} (and overall parse wikidata ids)

# XXX implement support for image files in {{mul-symbol|...}} head, e.g.,
# Unsupported titles/Cifrão

# XXX Some declination/conjugation template arguments contain templates, e.g.
# mi/Serbo-Croatian (pronoun).  Should probably strip these templates, but
# not strip as aggressively as normal clean_value() does.  HTML tags and links
# should be stripped.

# XXX review inserting error/warning tags in words that trigger errors/warnings

XXX {\tt Appendix:Variations of "a"} pages?  However Latn-script
template seems to know a ton about these so maybe look at it.

# XXX clean up extra calls to map_with in form_descriptions.py; now handled
# in decode_tags()

# XXX parse "Derived characters" section.  It may contain multiple
# space-separated characters in same list item.

# XXX extract Readings section (e.g., Kanji characters)

# XXX handle qualifiers starting with "of " specially.  They are quite common
# for adjectives, describing what the adjective can characterize

# XXX parse "object of a preposition", "indirect object of a verb",
# "(direct object of a verb)", "(as the object of a preposition)",
# "(as the direct object of a verbal noun)",
# in parenthesis at the end of gloss

# XXX parse [+infinitive = XXX], [+accusative = XXX], etc in gloss
# see e.g. βούλομαι.  These come from {{+obj|...}}, might also just parse
# the template.

# XXX parse "construed with XXX" from sense qualifiers or capture "construed with" template

# XXX add warnings about / in places where we try to parse tags

# XXX how about gloss "The name of the letter X",
# "The name of the Latin-script letter X"
# "The name of the Latin-script digraph XY",
# "The name of the Hebrew-script letter X"
# "The name of the Greek-script letter X"

# the same without The
# Letter of the X syllabary, transcribed as X
# Letter of the Tagbanwa abugida, transcribed as syllable X
# Letter of the X script, transcribed as X
# Letter of the X alphabet ...
# Letter of the X alphabet: ...

# XXX how about gloss "Compound of XXX and YYY".  There are 100k of these.
#   - sometimes followed by semicolon and notes or "-" and notes
#   - sometimes Compound of gerund of XXX and YYY
#   - sometimes Compound of imperative (noi form) of XXX and YYY
#   - sometimes Compound of imperative (tu form) of XXX and YYY

#   - sometimes Compound of XXX + YYY
#   - sometimes Compound of the gerund of XXX and YYY
#   - sometimes Compound of the imperfect XXX and the pronoun YYY
#   - sometimes Compound of the infinitive XXX and the pronoun YYY

# XXX occasionally Alternative form of ... followed by Alternative spelling of,
#   see &c

# XXX handle "Wiktionary appendix of terms relating to animals" ("animal")

# XXX check "Kanji characters outside the ..."

# XXX recognize "See also X" from end of gloss and move to a "See also" section

# XXX handle word class prefixes in linkages, see sade/Finnish,
# "adjectives: sateeton, sateinen"

# Look at "prenderle"/Italian - two heads under same part-of-speech.  Second
# head ends up inside first gloss.

# XXX make sure Alternative forms section is parsed (see, e.g., "& cetera")
# Also add to htmlgen.

# XXX handle (classifier XXX) at beginning of gloss; also (classifier: XXX)
# and (classifiers: XXX, XXX, XXX)
# E.g.: 煙囪
# Also: 筷子 (this also seems to have synonym problems!)

# XXX parse redirects, create alt_of

# XXX Handle "; also YYY" syntax in initialisms (see AA/Proper name)

# In htmlgen, create links from gloss, at minimum when whole gloss matches
# a word form in the same language (or maybe gloss as an alternative?)

# Check Finnish Abbreviation snses - many of them parentheses which are parsed
# incorrectly in alt_of

# XXX parse {{zh-see|XXX}} - see 共青团

# XXX is the Usage notes section parseable in any useful way?  E.g., there
# is a template {{cmn-toneless-note}}.  Are there other templates that would
# be useful and common enough to parse, e.g., into tags?

# XXX parse {{topics|lang|...|...}} - these seem to generate
# topic-related Categories.  However they can only be associated with
# the language, not sense or part-of-speech (unless inside sense).
# These are cleaner than trying to capture Category links.

# XXX capture topic hierarchy from Category pages in Wiktionary
#   - Module:category tree/topic cat/data/* (except /documentation)
#   - beware, at least .../Places contains real code besides data
#   - Load place types from Module:place/data
#   - also: Module:place/shared-data/tables
#   - also: Module:place/shared-data
# May be best to actually load these modules as Lua code or to even run a
# specific Lua module to dump the data.

# Check awake/English - strange unrecognized tags

# XXX search for Template: from all glosses, search for &amp; from all glosses

# XXX implement parsing of tags from first-level gloss in two-level lists
#    (see cut/English/Noun)

# XXX in parse_head_tags(), should create multiple forms if
# node["$"].get("tags") contains multiple sets of tags (e.g., cut/English/Verb)

# Check te/Spanish/pron, See also section (warning, has unexpected format)

# Check alt_of with "." remaining.  Find them all to a separate list
# and analyze.

# When alt-of has English translation (often in quotes), try to capture it
# (helpful for disambiguation!).  E.g., 假設/Vietnamese

# XXX wikipedia, Wikispecies links.  See "permit"/English/Noun

# XXX handle inflection of with multiple forms; see aquamarine/German/Adjective
#   - This is tricky.  This case is generated by {{de-adj form of|...}} and there
#     is no knowing how many such templates there are.  We may need to treat
#     the sub-entries as either equal senses or sub-senses.
#   - we should also fix treatment of *# etc; we need to just expand to
#     HTML, then split there (at line start), and then clean.  Otherwise we
#     risk breaking glosses that contain * or # (e.g., math formulas).

# XXX handle <ruby> specially in clean or perhaps already earler, see
# e.g. 無比 (Japanese)
  - should capture ruby
  - should capture roman

# XXX There are way too many <noinclude> not propersy closed warnings
# forom Chinese, e.g., 內 - find out what causes these, and either fix or
# ignore

# Parse readings subsection in Japanese kanji characters, see 內
#  - these are apparently pronunciations, but not IPA
#  - perhaps these might be parsed as forms with "reading" tag and tag
#    for the type of reading?

# Korean kanji seem to have Phonetic hangeul in pronunciation sections, see 內

# XXX chinese glyphs, see 內
#  - I'm getting dial-syn page does not exist in synonyms, but Wiktionary
#    shows a big list of synonyms

# XXX Some Chinese words have weird /wiki.local/ in sounds, see: 屋
#  - also in pronunciations, several IPAs are captured, but they are not
#    annotated with dialect information
#  - this page also has dial-syn warning in synonyms (also noted elsewhere)
#  - in Japanese compounds, roman transliterations incorrectly go into tags
#  - in Japanese, does it make sense to have most senses annotated with "kanji"?

htmlgen: Improve sense/word lists
  - more even sizes of sublists (use intervals when appropriate)
  - group kanji etc by radical + strokes

htmlgen: form-of (and alt-of) links in generated html should look at
canonical form in addition to word - now many items with accents are
not properly linked

htmlgen: strange Categories non-disambiguated in: https://kaikki.org/dictionary/English/meaning/v/vo/volva.html#volva-noun

htmlgen: include word prefixes in breadcrumbs

htmlgen: Implement better list page generation

htmlgen: compound-of field of sense not displayed in generated html

htmlgen: implement support for redirects

Word entires may be generated from entries like "Thesaurus:ar:make happy" that
are in a wrong language.  Check if they are referenced from somewhere and
maybe restrict generation to entries that are actually referenced.

In linkages, if the destination has multiple words separated by the special /,
treat them as different words. ／ = fullwidth solidus

If a Asian word has parenthesized sections, should they be treated as
different versions (in Japanese they look like pronunciations).  cf. Ruby.
  - partially implemented (for linkages), need also for translations and
    perhaps also for headword

Check extraction of pronunciations and their romanizations in 공중/Korean

In translations, should process {{trans-see|...}} (cf. "abound with",
the only translations are with {{trans-see|...}})

Consider caching template expansions in an LRU cache.  Make sure
template arguments that can be accessed from Lua are considered
properly.  Cache must be reset per-page.

Check * at the end of some derived forms in wort/English/Noun (e.g., dropwort*)
  - it actually is in the original wikitext and is used as a reference symbol,
    with explanation at the end of the table
  - should probably just remove the *
  - check if there are other similar reference symbols and how common they are

Apparently the following is not parsed correctly:
{{ws sense|any of enclosing symbols "(", ")", "[", "]", "{", "}" etc.}}

Recognize and parse {{zh-dial|...}} in linkage, e.g., 鼎/Chinese
  - Variety = language (these are more like translation than synonyms)
  - Location = tags, parenthesized part separate tag?
  - Words may have Notes references, which may need to be parsed as senses
    (not clear how common they are with other words)

{{syn|...}} not properly handled in nested glosses, see frons/Latin
sense "the forehead, brow, front", search for "vultus"

Consider parsing Alternative forms subsection - see 1/Translingual

English/fire/Noun/Translations (oxidation reaction) - Egyptian, "f"
in roman versions seems to go into "roman" field, even though it is
apparently gender

aunt/English/Translations: Armenian "paternal" goes in roman
aunt/English/Translations: Burmese - sense in parenthesis goes into "roman"

house/English/Noun: WARNING: Failed to find subpage section English house/Noun Noun Translations at ['house', 'see translation subpage']
  - looks like the Translations section is has additional === signs

Handle ruby in translations
Use classify_desc in translations for parenthesized parts
Support multiple parenthesized parts in translations, similar to linkage
